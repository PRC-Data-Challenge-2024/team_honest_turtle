# PRC Data Challenge 2024 - team_honest_turtle

## Introduction

Hello! I’m Somnath Panigrahi, currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Air Transport and Logistics at TU Dresden. In the PRC Data Challenge 2024, I’m competing as part of **team_honest_turtle**. This challenge offers a unique opportunity to apply data science techniques to the aviation sector by accurately estimating the **Actual TakeOff Weight (ATOW)** of flights based on flight and trajectory data.

The PRC Data Challenge aims to develop an open Machine Learning (ML) model capable of estimating ATOW, a critical metric used to calculate fuel consumption and emissions. By moving beyond generic assumptions of ATOW (often set as a fixed percentage of Maximum TakeOff Weight or MTOW), this challenge seeks to create a transparent, reproducible model that supports environmental impact assessments and fuel efficiency improvements.

### Datasets Overview

Two main datasets have been provided for this challenge:

1. **Data for Modeling**: This dataset contains flight details for **369,013 flights** in Europe in 2022, along with high-resolution trajectory data for a majority of these flights. The data has been organized as follows:

   - **Flight List** (`challenge_set.csv`):
     - **Flight Identification**: `flight_id` (unique identifier), `callsign` (obfuscated)
     - **Origin/Destination**: `adep` (departure airport ICAO code), `ades` (destination airport ICAO code), `name_adep`, `name_ades`, `country_code_adep`, `country_code_ades`
     - **Timing**: `date`, `actual_offblock_time`, `arrival_time`
     - **Aircraft Information**: `aircraft_type`, `wtc` (Wake Turbulence Category)
     - **Airline**: `airline` (obfuscated code)
     - **Operational Metrics**: `flight_duration`, `taxiout_time`, `flown_distance`, `tow` (TakeOff Weight in kg)

   - **Trajectory Data**:
     - Each file contains trajectory data at **1-second intervals** in `.parquet` format, resulting in approximately **158 GB** total.
     - **Fields**:
       - `flight_id`, `icao24`: Identifiers for each flight
       - **4D Position**: `longitude`, `latitude`, `altitude`, `timestamp`
       - **Speed and Track**: `groundspeed`, `track`, `track_unwrapped`, `vertical_rate`
       - **Meteorological Data** (where available): `u_component_of_wind`, `v_component_of_wind`, `temperature`

2. **Dataset for Submission**:
   - **Submission Set** (`submission_set.csv`): Contains **105,959 flights** that require ATOW estimates. The structure matches the Flight List, but with an empty `tow` column. For the final ranking, an additional **52,190 flights** will be included in `final_submission_set.csv`.

### Data Access

The data is accessible through two S3 buckets:

- `competition-data/`: Contains data for modeling, including the flight list (`challenge_set.csv`), daily trajectory files, and submission sets.
- `submissions/`: Stores the teams’ submissions for ranking, though contents are not listed publicly per account.

The `competition-data/` bucket is organized as follows:


### Data Types and Importance

Key data types include:

- **Categorical Variables**: `adep`, `ades`, `aircraft_type`, `airline`, `country_code_adep`, `country_code_ades`
- **Numerical Variables**: `flight_duration`, `taxiout_time`, `flown_distance`, `altitude`, `groundspeed`, `vertical_rate`
- **Temporal Variables**: `date`, `actual_offblock_time`, `arrival_time`, `timestamp`

### Real-World Applications

Estimating ATOW accurately has important real-world applications. Precise ATOW estimates allow for:

- **Fuel Efficiency**: By refining fuel load requirements, airlines can reduce fuel waste and minimize costs.
- **Environmental Impact Reduction**: Accurate ATOW is a vital input for emission models that estimate gaseous emissions based on actual fuel burned, supporting aviation’s commitment to environmental sustainability.
- **Operational Planning**: Airlines can optimize routes, plan for better weight distribution, and improve flight safety by understanding the precise takeoff weight requirements.

This challenge underscores the potential for data science to address pressing aviation issues, with an open approach that promotes transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration for a better understanding of aviation's environmental impact.

# Flight Take-Off Weight Prediction using Group-Specific Models and Inverse RMSE Weighting

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the **Take-Off Weight (TOW)** of flights using machine learning models. To achieve the best possible **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**, we employed multiple grouping methods to train group-specific models. We then applied an **inverse RMSE weighting** strategy to combine the predictions, thereby reducing the overall RMSE impact and improving prediction accuracy.

## Dataset

We used two datasets:

- **`challenge_set`**: Training dataset with known TOW values.
- **`submission_set`**: Test dataset for which TOW predictions are required.

Both datasets include various features related to flights, such as aircraft type, flight duration, environmental conditions, and categorical groupings.

## Approach

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

- **Data Loading**: Loaded the datasets and handled any exceptions during the process.
- **Data Optimization**:
  - Downcast numerical columns to reduce memory usage.
  - Converted object columns to categorical types.
- **GPU Availability**: Checked for GPU availability to optimize model training speed using PyTorch.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import logging
import os
import torch

# Define paths and logging
data_dir = r"F:\Project_PRC_Eurocontrol\NEW\2710"
model_dir = os.path.join(data_dir, 'Models')
os.makedirs(model_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Logging setup
log_file_path = os.path.join(model_dir, 'autogluon_training_log.txt')
logging.basicConfig(filename=log_file_path, level=logging.INFO,
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Define paths for datasets
challenge_set_path = os.path.join(data_dir, 'Updated_challenge_set_final_final.csv')

output_prediction_path = os.path.join(data_dir, 'final_predictions.csv')

# Load datasets
try:
    challenge_set = pd.read_csv(challenge_set_path)
    submission_set = pd.read_csv(submission_set_path)
    logging.info("Datasets loaded successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error loading datasets: {e}")
    raise

# Optimize DataFrames
def optimize_dataframe(df, df_name):
    initial_memory = df.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / (1024 ** 2)
    logging.info(f"Initial memory usage of '{df_name}': {initial_memory:.2f} MB")

    # Optimize numerical columns
    num_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['int', 'float']).columns
    df[num_cols] = df[num_cols].apply(pd.to_numeric, downcast='float', errors='ignore')

    # Convert object columns to category
    obj_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
    df[obj_cols] = df[obj_cols].apply(lambda x: x.astype('category'))

    optimized_memory = df.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / (1024 ** 2)
    logging.info(f"Optimized memory usage of '{df_name}': {optimized_memory:.2f} MB")
    return df

challenge_set = optimize_dataframe(challenge_set, 'challenge_set')
submission_set = optimize_dataframe(submission_set, 'submission_set')

# Check GPU availability
GPU_AVAILABLE = torch.cuda.is_available()
if not GPU_AVAILABLE:
    logging.warning("GPU is not available. Training will proceed on CPU.")
```

### 2. Grouping and Merging

- **Grouping Columns**: Defined multiple grouping columns to segment the data:
  - `wtc_Flight_distance_category`
  - `wtc_day_or_night_season`
  - `wtc_flight_category`
  - `ADB2_RECAT-EU_Flight_distance_category`
  - `ADB2_RECAT-EU_flight_category`
  - `Toff_speed_binned`
  - `landing_speed_binned`
- **Group Preparation**:
  - Combined the challenge and submission datasets to identify valid groups.
  - Selected groups with at least 100 flights to ensure sufficient data for training.

```python
def prepare_groups(challenge_df, submission_df, group_col, min_flights=100):
    combined_df = pd.concat([challenge_df[[group_col]], submission_df[[group_col]]], ignore_index=True)
    group_counts = combined_df[group_col].value_counts()
    valid_groups = group_counts[group_counts >= min_flights].index.tolist()
    submission_df = submission_df.copy()
    submission_df['group_assigned'] = submission_df[group_col].apply(lambda x: x if x in valid_groups else 'Ungrouped')
    return valid_groups, submission_df

group_columns = [
    'wtc_Flight_distance_category',
    'wtc_day_or_night_season',
    'wtc_flight_category',
    'ADB2_RECAT-EU_Flight_distance_category',
    'ADB2_RECAT-EU_flight_category',
    'Toff_speed_binned',
    'landing_speed_binned',
]

for group_col in group_columns:
    valid_group_names, submission_set = prepare_groups(
        challenge_set,
        submission_set,
        group_col,
        min_flights=100
    )
```

### 3. Training Group-Specific Models

- **Model Training**:
  - For each grouping column, iterated over each valid group.
  - Trained a separate model for each group using AutoGluon's `TabularPredictor`.
  - Saved the trained models for future predictions.
- **Model Storage**:
  - Stored the trained models in a dictionary with keys based on the grouping column and group name.

```python
from autogluon.tabular import TabularPredictor

loaded_group_models = {}

hyperparameters = {
    'GBM': {},
    'CAT': {},
    'XGB': {},
}

for group_col in group_columns:
    for group in valid_group_names:
        try:
            group_data = challenge_set[challenge_set[group_col] == group]
            if group_data.empty:
                continue

            sanitized_group = f"{group_col}_{str(group).replace('/', '_').replace(' ', '_')}"
            model_path = os.path.join(model_dir, f"model_{sanitized_group}")

            predictor = TabularPredictor(label='tow', path=model_path)
            predictor.fit(
                train_data=group_data.drop(columns=['flight_id']),
                hyperparameters=hyperparameters,
                time_limit=200,
                verbosity=1,
                ag_args_fit={}
            )
            loaded_group_models[(group_col, group)] = predictor
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to train model for group '{group}' in column '{group_col}': {e}")
            continue
```

### 4. Training a Global Model

- **Fallback Model**:
  - Trained a global model on the entire `challenge_set`.
  - Used as a fallback when a group-specific model is not available for a particular group.

```python
global_model_path = os.path.join(model_dir, 'model_global')
global_predictor = TabularPredictor(label='tow', path=global_model_path).fit(
    train_data=challenge_set.drop(columns=['flight_id']),
    hyperparameters=hyperparameters,
    time_limit=100,
    verbosity=2,
    ag_args_fit={}
)
```

### 5. Making Predictions

- **Group-Specific Predictions**:
  - For each flight in the `submission_set`, used the corresponding group-specific model to predict TOW.
  - If a group-specific model was not available, used the global model.
- **Prediction Storage**:
  - Stored all predictions in a DataFrame, with separate columns for each grouping method.

```python
final_predictions = pd.DataFrame()

for group_col in group_columns:
    group_assigned_values = submission_set[group_col].unique()
    for group in group_assigned_values:
        group_rows = submission_set[submission_set[group_col] == group]
        flight_ids = group_rows['flight_id']
        row_features = group_rows.drop(columns=['flight_id'])
        try:
            predictor = loaded_group_models.get((group_col, group), global_predictor)
            predictions = predictor.predict(row_features)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Prediction failed for group '{group}' in column '{group_col}': {e}")
            predictions = [np.nan] * len(group_rows)

        group_predictions = pd.DataFrame({
            'flight_id': flight_ids,
            'tow_predicted': predictions
        })

        final_predictions = pd.concat([final_predictions, group_predictions], ignore_index=True)
```

### 6. Calculating RMSE for Each Group

- **RMSE Calculation**:
  - Calculated the RMSE between predicted TOW and actual TOW for each group in the `challenge_set`.
  - Stored the RMSE values for each group and grouping column.
- **Result Storage**:
  - Saved the RMSE results to a CSV file for reference during the weighting process.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

rmse_results = []

for group_col in group_columns:
    for group in valid_group_names:
        group_data = challenge_set[challenge_set[group_col] == group]
        actual_tow = group_data['tow']
        sanitized_group = f"{group_col}_{str(group).replace('/', '_').replace(' ', '_')}"
        model_path = os.path.join(model_dir, f"model_{sanitized_group}")

        if os.path.exists(model_path):
            try:
                predictor = TabularPredictor.load(model_path)
                predictions = predictor.predict(group_data.drop(columns=['flight_id', 'tow']))
                rmse_value = mean_squared_error(actual_tow, predictions, squared=False)
                rmse_results.append({
                    'grouping_column': group_col,
                    'group': group,
                    'rmse': rmse_value
                })
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Failed to make predictions for group '{group}' in column '{group_col}': {e}")
                continue

rmse_results_df = pd.DataFrame(rmse_results)
rmse_results_df.to_csv(output_rmse_path, index=False)
```

### 7. Inverse RMSE Weighting

- **Weight Calculation**:
  - Computed inverse RMSE weights for each group:

    \[
    \text{Weight} = \frac{1}{\text{RMSE} + \epsilon}
    \]

    where \(\epsilon\) is a small constant to prevent division by zero.
- **Weight Mapping**:
  - Mapped the inverse RMSE weights to each flight in the `submission_set` based on their group assignments.

```python
submission_predictions = pd.DataFrame({'flight_id': submission_set['flight_id']})

# Map RMSE values and calculate weights
for grouping_column in group_columns:
    rmse_mapping = rmse_results_df[rmse_results_df['grouping_column'] == grouping_column].set_index('group')['rmse'].to_dict()
    rmse_col_name = f'rmse_{grouping_column}'
    weight_col_name = f'weight_{grouping_column}'
    group_col_name = grouping_column

    # Map RMSE to submission_set
    submission_predictions[rmse_col_name] = submission_set[group_col_name].map(rmse_mapping)
    # Calculate inverse RMSE weight
    submission_predictions[weight_col_name] = 1.0 / (submission_predictions[rmse_col_name] + 1e-6)
```

### 8. Generating Final Predictions

- **Weighted Averaging**:
  - Calculated the weighted average of the predictions from different models for each flight.
  - Gave more influence to models with lower RMSE (higher weights).
- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Addressed any missing predictions by filling them with the mean of available predictions.
- **Final Output**:
  - Generated the final TOW predictions for each flight.
  - Saved the final predictions to a CSV file.

```python
# Identify predicted_tow columns
predicted_tow_cols = [col for col in submission_predictions.columns if col.startswith('predicted_tow_')]

# Calculate the weighted average of predictions
numerator = pd.Series(0, index=submission_predictions.index, dtype=float)
denominator = pd.Series(0, index=submission_predictions.index, dtype=float)

for grouping_column in group_columns:
    pred_col = f'predicted_tow_{grouping_column}'
    weight_col = f'weight_{grouping_column}'
    if pred_col in submission_predictions.columns and weight_col in submission_predictions.columns:
        weighted_pred = submission_predictions[pred_col] * submission_predictions[weight_col]
        weighted_pred = weighted_pred.fillna(0)
        weight = submission_predictions[weight_col].fillna(0)
        numerator += weighted_pred
        denominator += weight

denominator = denominator.replace(0, np.nan)
submission_predictions['final_tow_prediction'] = numerator / denominator

# Handle missing predictions
submission_predictions['final_tow_prediction'].fillna(submission_predictions[predicted_tow_cols].mean(axis=1), inplace=True)

# Prepare final submission DataFrame
final_predictions_df = submission_predictions[['flight_id', 'final_tow_prediction']].copy()
final_predictions_df.rename(columns={'final_tow_prediction': 'tow'}, inplace=True)

# Save the final predictions to CSV
output_file = data_dir / 'final_tow_predictions.csv'
final_predictions_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
```

## Results

By utilizing multiple grouping methods and applying the inverse RMSE weighting strategy, we significantly improved the accuracy of our TOW predictions. Models with lower RMSE had a higher influence on the final prediction, effectively reducing the impact of less accurate models.

The RMSE values for each group were calculated and used to adjust the weights accordingly. This approach allowed us to leverage the strengths of various models trained on different segments of the data.

## Conclusion

The combination of group-specific models and inverse RMSE weighting proved to be an effective strategy for improving the accuracy of flight TOW predictions. By focusing on specific segments of data and adjusting the influence of each model based on its performance, we achieved a lower overall RMSE.

This method can be generalized to other prediction tasks where the data can be meaningfully grouped, and model performance varies across these groups.
